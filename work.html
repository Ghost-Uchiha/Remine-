                    <p class="content">E-Waste

                        Electronic waste, or e-waste, is a term for electronic products that have become unwanted, non-working or obsolete, and have essentially reached the end of their useful life. Because technology advances at such a high rate, many electronic devices become “trash” after a few short years of use. In fact, whole categories of old electronic items contribute to e-waste such as VCRs being replaced by DVD players, and DVD players being replaced by Blu-ray players. E-waste is created from anything electronic: computers, TVs, monitors, cell phones, PDAs, VCRs, CD players, fax machines, printers, etc.<span id="dots">...</span> <br><span id="more"><strong>Some of the benefits of e-waste recycling include:</strong>
                                <br>
                            ·         Conservation of natural resources:
                            
                            E-waste has a lot of recoverable and valuable resources like plastics, gold, copper, aluminum, and iron. To preserve our natural resources, all e-waste should be recycled and reused instead of dumped into landfills.
                            <br>
                            ·         Preventing soil contamination by toxic chemicals:
                            
                            E-waste can be loaded with hazardous materials like lead, chromium, mercury, chemical flame retardants, and beryllium, which can be harmful to our water and soil. Computers and servers can contain cadmium, mercury, and chromium. Flat-panel TVs and LCD screens can contain lead.
                            <br>
                            ·         Buy-back offers for customers:
                            <br>
                            Many computer and phone manufacturers provide buy-back offers for consumers who return their e-waste. By recycling this e-waste manufacturers are able to obtain a continuous supply of raw materials without the need for mining or further exploitation of natural resources. Consumers also enjoy the benefit of reduced pricing by committing to recycle cell phones, computers, and other common e-waste products.
                            
                            ·         Creating new jobs:
                            <br>
                            Recycling e-waste can create jobs for people involved in professional refurbishing and recycling. It can create new markets for materials and components. Other financial benefits due to e-waste recycling include minimization of transportation costs involved in movement of raw materials from one place to another and associated labor costs.
                            <br>
                            ·         Energy efficiency:
                            <br>
                            One of the biggest advantages of recycling e-waste is considerable reduction of energy requirements. The energy cost involved in e-waste recycling is comparatively less than the cost involved in mining and processing of new materials from soil. For example, recycling of aluminum will take ninety-five percent less energy than production of fresh aluminum from raw materials. Recycling of plastics can save up to 70% energy, recycling of glass up to 40% energy, while recycling of steel can save up to 60% energy.
                            
                            E-waste recycling also helps reduce air pollution, greenhouse gas emissions, and dependence on oil.</span></p>

                    <p class="content">Lithium Battery

                        Lithium batteries are disposable (primary) batteries that have lithium metal or lithium compounds as an anode. Depending on the design and chemical compounds used, lithium cells can produce voltages from 1.5 V to about 3.7 V, over twice the voltage of an ordinary zinc-carbon battery or alkaline cell battery. Lithium batteries are commonly used as power sources for portable electronics and implanted medical devices.
                        
                        Lithium batteries are used in many devices present in the workplace. They include pretty much all computers, cell phones, cordless tools, watches, cameras, flashlights, some medical devices, and vehicles ranging from golf carts, electric cars, airplanes and many others. Cell Phone Lithium Battery Batteries of all types are useful because they allow us to store energy for use whenever it is needed.
                        
                        Lithium Ion (Li-Ion) battery is a rechargeable battery with twice the energy capacity of a Nickel-Cadmium battery and greater stability and safety. LiIon batteries use a liquid lithium-based material for one of their electrodes. <span id="dots1">...</span>Lithium-ion batteries are used in applications that require lightweight and high-energy density solutions. These batteries provide the highest energy density per weight and are mostly used in cellular phones, notebook computers, and hybrid automobiles. <br><span id="more1"> <strong> Lithium Ion Battery Advantages </strong>
                            <br>
                            There are many advantages to using a li-ion cell of battery. These li-ion battery advantages include:
                            <br>
                            ·         High Energy Density: The much greater energy density is one of the chief advantages of a lithium ion battery or cell. With electronic equipment such as mobile phones needing to operate longer between charges while still consuming more power, there is always a need to batteries with a much higher energy density. In addition to this, there are many power applications from power tools to electric vehicles. The much higher power density offered by lithium ion batteries is a distinct advantage.
                            <br>
                            ·         Self-Discharge: One issue with batteries and ells is that they lose their charge over time. This self-discharge can be a major issue. One advantage of lithium ion cells is that their rate of self-discharge is much lower than that of other rechargeable cells such as Ni-Cad and NiMH forms.
                            <br>
                            ·         No Requirement for Priming: Some rechargeable cells need to be primed when they receive their first charge. There is no requirement for this with lithium ion cells and batteries.
                            <br>
                            ·         Low Maintenance: One major lithium ion battery advantage is that they do not require and maintenance to ensure their performance. Ni-Cad cells required a periodic discharge to ensure that they did not exhibit the memory effect. As this does not affect lithium ion cells, this process or other similar maintenance procedures are not required.
                            <br>
                            ·         Variety of Types Available: There are several types of lithium ion cell available. This advantage of lithium ion batteries can mean that the right technology can be used for the particular application needed. Some forms of lithium ion battery provide a high current density and are ideal for consumer mobile electronic equipment. Others are able to provide much higher current levels and are ideal for power tools and electric vehicles.</span></p>
